                <p className="about-description">
                    In today's fast-paced world, finding affordable flight tickets has become an essential part of many people's travel plans.
                    However, traditional flight search methods can be time-consuming, and unfortunately, there are many unreliable ticket agents
                    and misleading websites that prey on unsuspecting travelersâ€”especially students studying abroad. Having personally experienced
                    these frustrations, we understand the pain points firsthand.
